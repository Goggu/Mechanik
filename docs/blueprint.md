- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6) to provide a calm and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9800) to highlight the alert and action buttons, signifying urgency.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, providing a modern, neutral and readable style suitable for clear communication. 
- Use clear, recognizable icons for alert types and user actions. Icons should follow a consistent line style and be easily understandable at a glance.
- Employ a clean, intuitive layout that prioritizes ease of use. The alert screen should prominently display the key information, with clear action buttons.
- Use subtle animations to guide user interaction and provide feedback. For example, a gentle pulsing animation could be used to draw attention to the alert button.
